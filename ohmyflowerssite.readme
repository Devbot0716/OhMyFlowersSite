To start this app, run nodemon and live-server simultaneously in your terminal. (Should run on port 3000)

Uses SQL (postgres, elephantSQL.com for the API), NodeJS for backend, and AngularJs for front end.

I've created my own small, flower database using elephantSQL and pulled two other APIs for this project. One is a quotes API and the other is a random user API for fake reviews until I can learn how to make an input box that will let users input their own, personal reviews.
